**To Do**
- Find + Import College Basketball Data for 2018-2019 NCAA March Madness College Teams
- Perform data cleaning, remove NaNs, non-sensical, extraneous values
- Remove and augment features  of data frame
- PCA to determine which features correlate most heavily with correct results predictions
- Use previous tournament years as Validation / Testing Sets (+ Set up efficient testing framework)

**Thoughts**
- Think about "fine-tuning" data (aka how to deal with outlier games determined by extraordinary circumstances)
- Account for differences between regular and post season (player injuries, home court advantage, etc.)
- Data Normalization?
- The pros/cons of objective features (Points, Rebounds) vs. subjective metrics (National Ranking, Tourney Seed)
